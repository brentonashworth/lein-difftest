h1. lein-difftest

Leiningen plugin for running clojure.test tests. Works exactly the same as "lein test" but with alternate test reporting. When a test fails, the diff of the two forms is printed.

This plugin will only work with Leiningen 1.2.

h2. Usage

Add <code>[lein-difftest "1.0.0"]</code> to your project's :dev-dependencies.

<pre>
<code>
$ lein deps
$ lein difftest
</code>
</pre>
